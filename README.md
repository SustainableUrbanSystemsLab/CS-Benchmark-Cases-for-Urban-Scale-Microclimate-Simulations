## Abstract

Urban microclimatic analysis is essential in addressing challenges of urbanization and climate change, particularly the Urban
Heat Island (UHI) effect. Urban areas often experience significantly higher temperatures than their rural surroundings due to
the concentration of built surfaces and reduced vegetation. Studies estimate that UHI can increase daytime temperatures in U.S.
cities by approximately 1째C to 7째C and night-time temperatures by about 2째C to 5째C. (Drukenmiller, 2024)This research
introduces a framework employing canonical urban geometries to bridge the gap between theoretical microclimatic principles
and practical urban design applications. Developed through a systematic study of urban typologies, these geometries represent
diverse layouts, incorporating metrics like Sky View Factor (SVF), Aspect Ratio (AR), and Vegetation Cover.
Unlike traditional EPW files, which lack the granularity required for microclimatic precision, this approach enhances simulation
accuracy by integrating localized urban configurations. Canonical geometries capture critical interactions between urban form
and environmental factors, enabling comprehensive evaluations of wind flow, heat retention, and cooling strategies. Through
a comparative analysis of global urban layouts, this research demonstrates how tailored geometries can inform sustainable
design interventions, mitigate UHI impacts, and optimize urban energy performance.
